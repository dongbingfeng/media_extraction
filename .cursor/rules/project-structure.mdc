# Video Processing Tool

This is a Python-based video processing tool that provides functionality for:
- Extracting audio from videos
- Generating subtitles using Whisper AI
- Translating subtitles between languages
- Splitting audio files based on content markers
- Text-to-speech conversion

## Main Components

The main entry point is [video_process.py](mdc:video_process.py), which contains several key classes and functions:

### Core Classes
- `SrtBlock`: Represents a subtitle block with timing and text information

### Key Functions
1. Audio Processing:
   - `extract_audio_from_video()`: Extracts audio from video files
   - `split_audio_file()`: Splits audio files into segments

2. Subtitle Processing:
   - `extract_subtitles_from_audio()`: Generates subtitles using Whisper AI
   - `translate_srt_blocks()`: Translates subtitle blocks
   - `save_subtitle_file()`: Saves subtitles in SRT format

3. Text-to-Speech:
   - `text_to_speech()`: Converts text to speech
   - `batch_text_to_speech()`: Processes multiple text segments

## Command Line Interface

The tool provides several commands:
- `translate`: Translate existing SRT files
- `extract_audio`: Extract audio from video files
- `extract_srt`: Extract and translate subtitles from videos
- `split`: Split audio files based on content markers
