# Audio Processing Guide

This guide explains the audio processing capabilities of the video processing tool.

## Audio Extraction

The tool can extract audio from video files using FFmpeg:
- Supports multiple audio tracks
- Converts to MP3 format
- Sets sample rate to 16kHz for optimal Whisper processing
- Preserves original audio quality

## Audio Splitting

The `split_audio_file()` function:
1. Detects content markers in audio
2. Splits audio at specific time points
3. Creates separate audio files for each segment
4. Names files with sequential numbers and content markers

## Text-to-Speech

The tool provides two TTS functions:

1. Single text conversion:
   - `text_to_speech()` for individual text segments
   - Supports multiple languages
   - Configurable speech speed
   - Customizable TLD for Google services

2. Batch processing:
   - `batch_text_to_speech()` for multiple segments
   - Creates numbered output files
   - Maintains consistent settings across segments

## Usage Examples

1. Extract audio from video:
```bash
python video_process.py extract_audio input.mp4
```

2. Split audio file:
```bash
python video_process.py split input.mp3 --model base
```

3. Convert text to speech:
```python
text_to_speech("Hello world", "output.mp3", language="en")
```

## Best Practices

1. Audio Extraction:
   - Use appropriate audio track for best quality
   - Consider audio format compatibility
   - Monitor file sizes for large videos

2. Audio Splitting:
   - Use appropriate Whisper model size
   - Verify content markers are detected correctly
   - Check segment boundaries

3. Text-to-Speech:
   - Choose appropriate language code
   - Consider speech speed for clarity
   - Use batch processing for efficiency
